===== In-situ Plant CO2 Flux Meter --- UCSC [ECE129] 2019-2020 =====
This folder contains the final builds for the field unit, remote controller, and GUI software, shown in the demonstration videos here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-E8tHrf5m3iB22VZRvisIh7NXDdw7y6q.

========= Field Unit & Remote Unit Software ==========
This software was developed using the Arduino IDE v1.8.12, available here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software, and the Arduino IDE add-on, Teensyduino, available here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html.

On Windows, the ‘main’ folder should be included under the path ‘~\Documents\Arduino’ to give the Arduino IDE access to these files. 

The ‘state machine’ folder should be included under the path ‘~\Documents\Arduino\libraries’ to give the Arduino IDE access to these files.

Finally, the support libraries must be included under the path ‘~\Documents\Arduino\libraries’.

========= iOS App GUI =========
This software was developed using the Xcode IDE v11 for an iPhone SE running iOS 11.0.3. Xcode is available on the App Store, free for any MacOS devices.
