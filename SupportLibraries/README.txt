This folder contains all of the support libraries used for this project. While some of these files were written by the project team, the majority of these 
libraries were not. Some of these borrowed libraries have been modified to better fit the project needs. 

These files should be in the path ‘\Documents\Arduino\libraries’ to give the Arduino IDE access.
