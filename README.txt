This repository is used to store program files related to the In-situ Plant CO2 Flux Meter project. These files are organized into three main folders, each with their own README: 
	FinalizedCode ------ contains the primary control code which can be loaded onto the various components of the project to operate the entire system. 
	TestCode ----------- contains files that can be used to test different parts of the system. 
	SupportLibraries --- contains files which are to be used with the finalized and test code for communication with the hardware peripherals.
