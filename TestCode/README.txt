===== In-situ Plant CO2 Flux Meter --- UCSC [ECE129] 2019-2020 =====
This folder contains the test code for the hardware and peripherals. 
This software was developed using the Arduino IDE v1.8.12, available here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software, and the Arduino IDE add-on, Teensyduino, available here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html.

On Windows, the ‘main’ folder for any test should be included under the path ‘~\Documents\Arduino’ to give the Arduino IDE access to these files.

Finally, the support libraries must be included under the path ‘~\Documents\Arduino\libraries’.

Many of these tests make use of printouts to the serial monitor. To view the serial monitor, connect the USB cable and go to Tools>Port: and select the Teensy LC. Then click the magnifying glass symbol on the top right side of the Arduino IDE to open the serial monitor.
